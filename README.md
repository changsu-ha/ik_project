# ik_project

This project aims to provide forward and inverse kinematics solutions for robot models described in URDF. The results can be visualized using [Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/).

## Setup

Install the project in an isolated environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

This will pull in the `rerun-sdk` dependency specified in `pyproject.toml`.
